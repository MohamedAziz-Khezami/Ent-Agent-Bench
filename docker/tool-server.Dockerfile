# NOTE: src/db/scenarios/crm_scenario/tasks/ (the task generator + 90 frozen
# JSON files) is copied along with the rest of src/db/ but is never touched
# at runtime here — tasks are selected/seeded on the host, not inside this
# container. Left as one COPY for now since I can't verify a narrower COPY
# against a real `docker build` without the daemon running; safe to trim
# once that's available.
