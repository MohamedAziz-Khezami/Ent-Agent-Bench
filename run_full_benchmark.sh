# run_full_benchmark.sh — runs the full benchmark against every model in
# models.yaml, one at a time: starts that model's llama-server, waits until
# it's actually ready to serve (polls /v1/models rather than a fixed sleep,
# since load time varies enormously by model size — 12B loads in a couple
# minutes, 72B split across two files can take much longer, especially on
# a cold cache), runs the full benchmark against it, then stops that
# llama-server before moving to the next model. Never runs two models'
# servers at once, since several of these are close to the workstation's
# VRAM ceiling on their own.
#
# Usage: ./run_full_benchmark.sh [difficulty]
#   difficulty defaults to "all" (every tier). Pass "easy", "medium", "hard",
#   or "expert" to restrict to one tier instead.
#
# Requires: llama-server on PATH, python3 with this repo's deps installed,
# and enough disk for whichever models aren't already cached under
# ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/.
set -uo pipefail  # deliberately not -e: one model failing must not abort the rest
